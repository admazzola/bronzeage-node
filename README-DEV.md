# This is the open-source Developer readme for the 'Revolt' client for Decentraland.  This is a prioritized task list for implementations to build.  

1) Switch the content saving and rendering system from Unity to AFrame (https://aframe.io/docs/0.6.0/introduction/)

  In Bronze age, a 3D scene that was created in Unity was uploaded to IPFS and then tied to the Bronzeage client in order to render it.  In the Revolt client, this must change so that a snippet of AFrame code is uploaded to IPFS instead which will then be rendered in the client.
